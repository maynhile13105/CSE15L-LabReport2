## ***Part 3***
- The first thing I learned in the past two weeks is how to compile and run Java programs via command. Previously, to run a certain program, I had to use that language's IDE, which took up most of my computer's memory. After knowing how to use commands, I can operate directly on my computer or need software like Visual Studio Code to run the program. This makes my computer work faster.
- The second thing I really like is that I can understand more about the server. Before, I had only heard of 'server' but had no idea what it was. The past 2 weeks also taught me how to create and run a server. I can also log in to another server remotely. I can also clearly understand the URL through operations when running a server.
